<h1>Mission</h1>
<p>The primary motivating force behind the <a title="Home" href="http://openconnectomeproject.org/">Open Connectome Project</a> is to make state-of-the-art neuroscience open to anybody with computer access, regardless of knowledge, training, background, etc.  <a href="http://creativecommons.org/science">Open science</a> means open to view, play, analyze, contribute, anything.</p>
<p>We are interested in all levels of  &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome">connectomes</a>&#8221; , from the nano (using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscopy">electron microscopy</a>) to the macro (using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging">magnetic resonance imaging</a>). We (and others) conjecture that connectomes contain troves of information about who we are and how we tick. The size and multi-center nature of these data sets makes hosting services for these data beyond the scope of many individual labs. Therefore, the <a title="Home" href="http://openconnectomeproject.org/">Open Connectome Project</a> facilitates the analysis of connectome data by providing a unified front for connectomics research.</p>
<p>Specifically, these days, we focus on the two kinds of data sets mentioned above: Electron Microscopy (EM) data and various forms of Magnetic Resonance (MR) data.  With regard to the MR data, the NIH recently <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-DA-11-021.html">announced</a> a Request for Information (RFI): Expansion of sharing and standardization of NIH-funded human brain imaging data.  We responded to several keys point of interest </a><a title="NIH RFI" href="http://openconnectomeproject.org/nih-rfi/">here</a>.</p>
